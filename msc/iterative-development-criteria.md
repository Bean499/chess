* Provided evidence of each stage of the iterative development process for a coded solution relating this to the break down of the problem from the analysis stage and explaining what they did, justifying why.
* Provided evidence of prototype versions of their solution for each stage of the process.
* The solution will be well structured and modular in nature.
* Code will be annotated to aid future maintenance of the system.
* All variables and structures will be appropriately names.
* There will be evidence of validation for all key elements of the solution,
* The development will show review at all key stages in the process.
* Provided evidence of testing at each stage of the iterative development process.
* Provided evidence of any failed tests and the remedial actions taken with full justification for any actions take.
