This document intends to roughly chart what should happen in what order in the main game,
since just writing it is a very daunting task without any planning.

While neither king is in check:
    While it is a player's turn:
        Decrement the timer every second
        If the currently active player attempts a move:
            Accept it
            Toggle the boolean that tracks which player is moving
        If the currently inactive player attempts a move:
            Reject it
