# Chess Coursework Project
This is my year 13 OCR A Level Computer Science coursework. I am coding chess with online multiplayer functionality in Javascript. It will be made using Electron.
## To-do List:
Currently most of the trouble will be in getting the visual and internet based parts to work, since I sorted out almost all of the game's logic in the **3.2.2 Design the Solution** section.
* ~~**Start testing and writing about modules!**~~
* ~~Check the scope of variables in existing files. Add var, const, and let to make things clearer when you come back to the code.~~
* Make the actual **while** loop that the game runs in
* ~~Sort out castling by removing the validation from King.movePattern and moving that to Piece.getValidMoves~~
* Think of a name for the project
* ~~Set the project up as an actual [Electron Application](https://www.electronjs.org/)~~
* ~~Figure out how to import the [P5JS library](p5js.org) and use that to implement the visual aspect of the game~~
* ~~Figure out how to make it work over the internet~~ *SCRAPPED*
* UI updates
* Turn history timeline
* File handling for match history
