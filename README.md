# Chess Coursework Project
This is my year 13 OCR A Level Computer Science coursework. I am coding a multiplayer chess game in Javascript. It uses Electron and Electron Forge to run and be distributed.
## Installation
Head over to the releases tab on the right and go to the latest version. Download `chess-win32-x64.zip` and open chess.exe to play the game.
